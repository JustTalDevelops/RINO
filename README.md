# RINO
The anti-raid bot that protects against raids by checking a users message rate.

## Are you tired of annoying raids?

Me too. Which is why I made RINO, the bot that can detect a raid just with a few messages and automatically punishes the user and deletes their messages. No need to deal with annoying CAPTCHA verifications, or those ineffective emoji verification systems that servers love to use. Just add RINO, and keep chatting like you'd normally. RINO watches all messages in the background and analyses each user for you, so you can relax and chat with your community without worries of raids.

## Add RINO to your server!
